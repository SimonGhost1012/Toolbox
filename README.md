# ℹ️ Info
This is my personal Toolbox, made in Batch, C#, and .NET. It contains no malware or similar threats.

For older versions of Toolbox (V1.0 to V1.2), it is recommended to create a shortcut as shown below:

# ⬇ Installation                                         
1. Download the Toolbox VX.X.zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/SimonGhost1012/ToolBox/releases).

2. Extract the zip file wherever you want using [7-Zip](https://7-zip.com/download.html) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html).

3. Run Install-Update Requirements.bat so Toolbox runs properly.

# ❓ FAQ
**Q: How do I update Toolbox?**

A: Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/SimonGhost1012/Toolbox/releases) page and replace the old files.

For versions V1.7+, you don’t need to download manually anymore, as Toolbox now includes an updater, but you still need to replace the files manually.
